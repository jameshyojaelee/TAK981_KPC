KPC cells treated with TAK981

Ximbio explanation of KPC:
The KPC mouse is an established and clinically relevant model of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) which develops many key features observed in human PDA including pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia alongside a robust inflammatory reaction including exclusion of effector T cells. Metastases are observed in around 80% of KPC animals located primarily in the liver and lungs. Mutations in both KRAS and TP53genes are found in around 80% and 70% of all human PDAs respectively. Tumors present in KPC mice display many immunohistological markers of PDA as well as possessing complex genomic rearrangements â€“ a key sign of genomic instability. The co-morbidities, cachexia, jaundice and ascites, associated with human PDA are also observed in this model and most pancreatic tumors are resistant to chemotherapy.
